Bike Rental Web Application (MERN Stack)

This project is a web-based bike rental application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The system provides an online platform where bike owners can register and list their bikes for rent, while customers can search, view, and book available bikes for a selected duration.

The application follows a role-based structure with three main user types: admin, bike provider, and client. The admin manages users, bike listings, and overall system activities to ensure smooth operation of the platform.

The project is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface and follows a scalable architecture. It supports future enhancements such as an earning module, car rental services, and online payment integration.
